  You have created a new function which uses Golang 1.11 and the Classic
  OpenFaaS template.

  To include third-party dependencies, use a vendoring tool like dep:
  dep documentation: https://github.com/golang/dep#installation

  For high-throughput applications, we recommend using the golang-http
  or golang-middleware templates instead available via the store.
